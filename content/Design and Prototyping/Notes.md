## Notes
- keep james bruton in mind
	- He has a new cycloidal drive video [here](https://youtu.be/ZUi7jBwxh0g)

- use solderable breadboard pcbs for final stuff
	- use Breadboards in meantime while prototyping 
- keep it simple
	- dont Think encoders will be necessary 
	- However, maybe some limit sensing

## (2024-02-16)
- imp: Need to undersize holes on load plate for drilling and tapping.
	- Possibly machine this part later, since plastic threads probably aren't great.
	- inserts too big (too close to edge of load plate boss)
	- ==about 2.5mm== diameter in cad should be good for a pilot hole

- Eccentric nut is too small to reliably produce using FDM printing. I need to look at other options:
	- Resin printing (Will the resin be strong enough?)
	- laser cutting (Worried about kerf)
	- machining (may be difficult due to d-shaft and eccentricity)
	- UPDATE: Turns out a typo caused the parametric design to get completely out of whack
		- once I realized my mistake and reprinted, the prints worked.
