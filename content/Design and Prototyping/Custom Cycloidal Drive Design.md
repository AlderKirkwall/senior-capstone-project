# Custom Cycloidal Drive Design
I'm designing a custom cycloidal drive as part of my project. See [[Video Notes - Cycloidal Drives]] for the research on this topic

See [[Cycloidal Drive Parameters]] for my efforts to learn how to design a cycloidal drive in CAD software.

If I make my roller pins 3mm in diameter, then my ring gear diameter can be about 45mm, leaving room for the casing thickness.
- I can purchase and harden (if necessary) stainless steel dowel pins that are already 3mm diameter [amazon link](https://a.co/d/iMfAhoU)
	- ! This will not work for the most common type of stainless steel dowel pins: 304 SS is not heat treatable.
	- However, I think they'd still work for my application w/o hardening

Something like this:

I just found a resource that should be very helpful for design. This guy made a similarly sized cycloidal drive
