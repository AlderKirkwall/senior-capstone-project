# Video Notes - Types of bearings and its applications

A mechanical component used to reduce friction between moving parts

As surface contact increases, so does load capacity. However, friction increases as well

Types of Bearings:
1. Radial
2. Thrust
3. Journal
4. Special Purpose

Types of load:
- radial and 
- axial loads

Ball bearings:
1. Single Row: radial
2. Double Row: higher load capacity
3. Deep Groove: low friction, high speed
4. angular contact:

5. Self Aligning
6. thrust ball bearing: axial loads only

Roller Bearings:
Support for a rotating shaft. High load capacity
1. Straight roller bearing
2. tapered roller bearing: axial and radial
3. cylindrical roller: axial
4. spherical roller bearing: radial and axial

Journal or sliding Bearings
Just straight up full surface contact. (think brass bushings)

Special Purpose
1. Magnetic bearings
2. giant roller bearing: used in buildings and large structures
