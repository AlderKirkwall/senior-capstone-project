# Video Notes - Bearing Classification

Two kinds:
- sliding contact
- rolling contact
- ([00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urgaH74hv0#t=33.728036032424924))
Three functions:
1. carrying a load
2. reducing friction
3. positioning moving parts

Two kinds:
1. ball
2. roller

Types of ball bearings
- Shallow groove
	- designed for radial loads
- deep groove
	- moderate radial
	- small amount of axial loads
- spherical race
	- aka self-aligning a deep grove race and a "spherical" race
- Angular contact
	- one high shoulder on inner, one on oppisite side on outer ring
	- often used in pairs to allow for axial loading from either direction
- Ball thrust bearing
	- for axial loads

Roller Bearings
Can carry more load than ball bearings
Types:
- cylindrical
	- heavy radial loads
- needle roller
	- heavy radial loads
	- "low profile"
- tapered roller bearings
	- support radial and axial loads
- barrel/spherical roller bearings
	- primarily radial loads
- roller thrust bearing
	- For heavy axial loading

Bearings require precision

Bearing housings
- Pillow block
- built-in 
Pillowblock 
- outside the machine
