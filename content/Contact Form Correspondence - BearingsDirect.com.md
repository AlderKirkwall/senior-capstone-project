To whom it may concern,

I'm currently in the process of designing a 6-axis robotic arm for my senior capstone project. Having looked through your bearing catalog, I thought they might be a good choice for my project. Do have any educational offerings or discounts? Additionally, I'm willing to display your brand on my project in exchange for whatever you might be willing to give. 

Thank you,

Spencer Chapple
