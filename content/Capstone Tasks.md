# Capstone Tasks

## Design
- [x] follow [[Cycloidal Drives Are The Beating Hearts of Robotics. Here's How You Can Easily Design One Yoursel...|this article]] and the notes I took to model my cycloidal drive ‚úÖ 2024-02-12
- [x] 3D Printing Hole Tolerances #engineering/gd-and-t ‚úÖ 2024-02-15
	- [x] Model a test article ‚úÖ 2024-02-15
	- [x] print test article ‚úÖ 2024-02-15
	- [x] cross check model dimensions and print dimensions ‚úÖ 2024-02-15
	- [x] learn how to adjust settings in prusaslicer accordingly ‚úÖ 2024-02-15
- [x] Create mechanical drawings for cycloidal drive with tolerances #capstone ‚è≥ 2024-02-16 ‚úÖ 2024-02-17

## Drawings
- [ ] Create exploded view of cycloidal drive #capstone ‚è≥ 2024-02-28 üìÖ 2024-03-04

## Documentation and Records
- [ ] Create project BOM
- [x] Tabulate #capstone expenses üìÖ 2024-02-15 ‚úÖ 2024-02-15 ^4347ce
- [ ] (20:58) Catch up on project documentation #capstone 
	- [ ] Tolerancing methods and iterations - notes, etc.
	- [ ] Progress
	- [ ] Thoughts
	- Honestly, Just prepare a website documenting it.
	- Start thinking about/preparing a presentation
- [ ] (14:37) Make note of the various research and design tasks I've completed/started for my #capstone project

## Control
- [x] Learn if the octopus board will work well for what I need ‚úÖ 2024-02-27
	- I think it would take more time than it's worth
	- moving forward (after some research) with the [[Teensy¬Æ 4.0]]
		- 7 hardware serial ports

## Research
- [ ] check out this [vid on optical encoder](https://youtu.be/NonCPKgxLJg) 
- [ ] (‚úèÔ∏è22:46) Take notes on [Stepper Motors and Arduino - The Ultimate Guide](https://youtu.be/7spK_BkMJys)  ‚è¨
- [ ] take notes on [this video on stepper motors](https://youtu.be/bkqoKWP4Oy4) 
- [ ] Do [[Control Any Robot Arm with MoveIt and ROS - Medium]] tutorial #capstone ‚è≥ 2024-02-28
