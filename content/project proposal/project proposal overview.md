# Project Proposal Overview
Guidelines and requirements for the project proposal are outlined in the [[Capstone Project Proposal.pdf|Capstone Project Proposal]] document. The contents of said document are summarized as follows:

**Requirements**
- [[Rationale|rationale]] for selecting and constructing the project[^1] 
- a [[Description|description]] of what you expect the project to do when it is completed[^2] 
- a [[Education and Learning/Capstone/project proposal/Block Diagram|block diagram]] of the project[^3] 
- a [[Schedule Time Table|time table or schedule]] of what you will accomplish and when it will be done.[^4] 
- a [[Cost Estimate|cost estimate]] projecting how much you will spend to complete the project.[^5] 
- a [[Signature Sheet|faculty signature sheet]] that will become a contract between you and the EET department faculty.[^6] 

I'd like to use as much as I can from what I've already written for the [[Connect Grant Index and Description|connect grant]] application. I've compiled these within the [[Connect Grant/Application Essays#Project Abstract]] and [[Initial Budget]] notes. This [[project proposal canvas.canvas|canvas]] will be used for brainstorming and linking ideas and drafts for the proposal. This [[proposal document structure map|drawing]] will be used to brainstorm the structure of the document.
