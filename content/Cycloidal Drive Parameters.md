# Cycloidal Drive Parameters

- [n] (11:20) The parametric equations from [[Building-a-Cycloidal-Drive-with-SOLIDWORKS]] don't seem to work for the size of cycloidal drive I have in mind. 
	- I found another resource by [ewhiteowls.com](https://www.ewhiteowls.com/2022/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-design-cycloidal-drives-the-beating-heart-of-robotic-arms/) that should hopefully do nicely.
- [n] (11:24) [ewhiteowls.com](ewhiteowls.com) also has a tutorial on a [diy slew bearing](https://www.ewhiteowls.com/2021/07/heres-how-you-can-also-design-3dprint-slew-bearing/)
- [n] (11:32) Also, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9vLVXjz2c0) by RoTechnic on how to use python and fusion360 to design a cycloidal drive.
