# Robotic Arm, Incorporating Custom Actuators and Machine Learning

My capstone project, officially beginning at the beginning of the Spring 2024 semester, will be to design, fabricate, and build a custom robotic arm. My project has three main parts:
1. Mechanical Design: I will need to design the frame and body of the robot, considering its dimensions and what kinds of loads it may experience in order to design it strong enough support its own weight and/or movements. I will also be designing a robotic actuator for the joints of the robot that will require detailed 3D models and assemblies, as well as prototyping.
2. Electrical Design: I will need to take into account the various electrical components and the connections between them, designing wiring harnesses for power and data, sizing the power supply correctly, choosing motors for the actuators of sufficient power, choosing motor drivers specific for my needs, etc.
3. Software Design: I will be using ROS (Robot Operating System), a free and open source robotics framework to program and control the robot. Additionally, I will be incorporating machine vision using open source python libraries to give the robot the ability to recognize objects and respond accordingly.
To accomplish each of these tasks, I will do the following: 
- Weeks leading up to and first weeks of the semester:
	- Perform the necessary research to finalize the concept and basic design of the robot, including choosing specific motors, type of actuators, gripper design and functionality, power supply, static calculations, etc.
- Semester Start to Midterm
	- Mechanical design and prototyping
	- Electronics Design
	- Programming + ML
- Midterm to End
	- Final Design
	- Electronics "polishing"
	- Finish Software
	- Prepare Project Presentation
Throughout, I intend to keep documentation of as much as possible throughout the time I'm doing the project.
