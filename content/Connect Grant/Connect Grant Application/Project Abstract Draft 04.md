Notes: Mention how it will help me land a job

My capstone project, officially starting in Spring semester, will be to design, fabricate, and build a custom desktop-size robotic arm. In order to achieve overall functionality of the design I will seamlessly integrate the following:
1. Mechanical Design: 
	- The body and frame of the robot: designing it to be able to meet the design requirement. 
	- Actuators: design a compact actuator using readily available brushless drone motors.
2. Electrical Design: 
	- Power supply system
	- Control systems
	- Wiring
	- PCBs
3. Software Design: 
	- ROS (Robot Operating System) as programming framework
	- Planning and designing of software functionality and structure
	- Incorporating Python machine vision libraries for object recognition and intelligent responsiveness.

To accomplish each of these tasks, I will do the following: 
- Weeks leading up to and first weeks of the semester:
	- Research:
		- ROS
		- Machine Vision, Python
		- Optimal SBCs for AI applications 
		- Engineering calculations
		- Previous/Similar design problems
- Semester Start to Midterm
	- Finalize a mechanical design
	- Prototyping of designs
	- Electronics Design
	- Programming + ML
- Midterm to End
	- Final Design
	- Electronics "polishing"
	- Finish Software
	- Prepare Project Presentation
