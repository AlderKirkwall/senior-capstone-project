My capstone project, officially beginning at the beginning of the Spring 2024 semester, will be to design, fabricate, and build a custom robotic arm. My project has three main parts:
1. Mechanical Design: The body and frame of the robot: designing it to be able to handle design specified criteria. Actuators: design a compact actuator using readily available brushless drone motors.
3. Electrical Design: choosing the appropriate power supply, computer, and motor drivers, as well as any PCBs and wiring necessary to carry power and data throughout the robot.
4. Software Design: Using the Robot Operating System, or ROS, as a framework, write the necessary code for the robot to respond how I wish. Additionally, I will be incorporating machine vision using open source Python libraries to give the robot the ability to recognize objects and respond accordingly.
To accomplish each of these tasks, I will do the following: 
- Weeks leading up to and first weeks of the semester:
	- Perform the necessary research to finalize the concept and basic design of the robot
- Semester Start to Midterm
	- Finalize a mechanical design
	- Prototyping of designs
	- Electronics Design
	- Programming + ML
- Midterm to End
	- Final Design
	- Electronics "polishing"
	- Finish Software
	- Prepare Project Presentation
Throughout, I intend to keep documentation of as much as possible throughout the time I'm doing the project.
