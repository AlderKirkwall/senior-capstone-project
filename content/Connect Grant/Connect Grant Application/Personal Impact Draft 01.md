Briefly describe how this travel will impact your educational, professional and/or personal life. (250 word maximum). 

With the funding provided by the CONNECT Grant, I'll be able to complete my capstone project. My capstone project will serve me in various ways:

Educationally, my capstone project will allow me to realize the knowledge I've gathered throughout my college career in the form of a physical, real-world project. I'll be able to solidify what I've learned and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts that drive mechanical, electrical, and software engineering.

Professionally, my capstone project will serve as proof to prospective employers not only of my abilities and skills, but also of my passion for engineering and my strong work ethic. I want my capstone to be the first of many examples of what I can accomplish when provided the appropriate tools and means.

Personally, my capstone project will allow me to prove to myself that I am capable of solving complex engineering problems. Though I believe strongly that I am capable of doing anything I set my mind to, I have as yet not faced a truly challenging engineering problem that encapsulates the things I am most passionate about in engineering. By completing this project, my belief will become knowledge which will allow me to proceed through life with even greater confidence than before.
