*Explain how your project takes your learning beyond the classroom and allows you learn and to perform at a level not possible without CONNECT Grant funding (250 word maximum). *

Prior to my capstone project, I've never had quite this big an opporitunity to take what I've learned during my educcation to the next level. With the assistance of the CONNECT Grant, I'll be able to showcase my ability for Mechanical Design, my skills and knowledge in the field of electronics, and my background in Software Engineering an ddesign.

With the mechanical design of my project, I'll have the opporitunity to actually build a physical mechanical design as the combination of the robot's frame and its supporting actuators. The actuators themselves will be mechanically complex involving gear reduction and consideration of motor torque and RPM.

As for electrical design, I'll be able to solidify the theory I've learned in my courses by desiging and troubleshooting a more realistic electrical assembly. I'll be able to show that I can take a challenging real-world electrical problem and solve it using my advanced understanding.

Of course, software design cannot be forgotten, as it is what truly brings life to the whole project. The project will necessitate that I develop complex software to manage the various electromechanical systems of the robot, perform mathematical calculations, and interpret video input and respond according to its machine learning training.

None of this would be possible without the constituent components that make up the robot including but not limited to: the Single Board Computer, motors, motor drivers, 3D printer filament for structure and rapid prototyping, wiring, etc. The CONNECT grant will provide me with the means to aquire most, if not all of these components and therefore allow me to expand my understanding of the Electromechanical Engineering that I've grown to love.
