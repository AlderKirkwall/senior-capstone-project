Notes: Mention how it will help me land a job

My capstone project, officially starting in Spring semester, will be to design, fabricate, and build a custom desktop-size robotic arm. In order to achieve overall functionality of the design I will seamlessly integrate the following: Mechanical Design, Electrical Design, and Software Design
```
transistion to paragraph explinations...
```
1. Mechanical Design,
	- The body and frame of the robot: designing it to be able to meet the design requirements. 
		- Actuators: design a compact actuator using readily available brushless drone motors. `explain briefly what an actuator what it is. Express the challenges of designing a compact actuator using availble motors: allowing for enough strength, etc. Talk about most what I'm most passionate about.`
2. Electrical Design, `Mention the challenges that I'll face et. al. the unknowns of the process. emphasize how this is a learning experience and not just a "pet project". Emphasise how I actually need this funding. I'm putting into practice what I learned in class.`
	- Power supply system
	- Control systems
	- Wiring
	- PCBs
3. Software Design,
	- ROS (Robot Operating System) as programming framework
	- Planning and designing of software functionality and structure
	- Incorporating Python machine vision libraries for object recognition and intelligent responsiveness. `Make Narrative`

To accomplish each of these tasks, I will do the following: 
- Weeks leading up to and first weeks of the semester:
	- Research:
		- ROS
		- Machine Vision, Python
		- Optimal SBCs (Single Board Computers) `make sure to include this in the beginning as well` for AI applications 
		- Engineering calculations
		- Previous/Similar design problems
- Semester Start to Midterm
	- Finalize a mechanical design
	- Prototyping of designs
	- Electronics Design
	- Programming + ML `Machine Learning / Python`
- Midterm to End
	- Final Design
	- Electronics "polishing"
	- Finish Software
	- Prepare Project Presentation


```Notes
Prioritize the first half. Okay to simplify the timeline.
